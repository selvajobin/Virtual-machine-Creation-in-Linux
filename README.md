 # VIRTUAL MACHINE CREATION IN LINUX

## AIM

To Install Virtualbox / VMware Workstation and execute basic Linux commands like pwd, mkdir, ls, date, cat, and writing a Bash script to perform arithmetic operations and read a file from the terminal.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Manually executing basic Linux tasks like file management, navigation, and arithmetic operations can be inefficient. This experiment aims to automate these tasks using Bash scripting, including:
1. Displaying the current directory, files, and system date.
2. Reading and displaying file contents.
3. Performing basic arithmetic operations.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Oracle VM VirtualBox MAnager
- Kali Linux
- Mousepad (Text Editor)
- Terminal

## ALGORITHM
 ### Step 1: 
 Open the terminal in Kali Linux.
 ### Step 2:
 Use basic Linux commands to navigate and manage files.
 ### Step 3:
 Create a Bash script using Mousepad.
 ### Step 4:
 Write a script that performs arithmetic operations and reads a file.
 ### Step 5:
 Make the script executable.
 ### Step 6:
 Run the script and observe the output.
 
## COMMANDS

###  Execute Basic Linux Commands in the Terminal
#### Check the Current Working Directory
```
pwd
```
#### Create a New Directory
```
mkdir my_experiment
```

#### Navigate into the Directory
```
cd my_experiment
```
#### List the Files in the Directory
```
ls
```

#### Write Some Text into the File
```
echo "Hello, this is a test file." > myfile.txt
```

#### Read the File Contents
```
cat myfile.txt
```
#### Get the Current Date and Time
```
date
```

###  Writing a Bash Script in Mousepad
#### Open Mousepad
```
mousepad myscript.sh &
```

#### Write the Bash Script

```
#!/bin/bash 

echo "Current Directory:"
pwd

echo "Files in this directory:"
ls

echo "Current Date and Time:"
date

read -p "Enter first number: " num1
read -p "Enter second number: " num2

sum=$((num1 + num2))
diff=$((num1 - num2))
prod=$((num1 * num2))
quot=$((num1 / num2))
rem=$((num1 % num2))

echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $diff"
echo "Product: $prod"
echo "Quotient: $quot"
echo "Remainder: $rem"


```
####  Make the Script Executable
```
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

#### Run the Script
```
./myscript.sh
```

## OUTPUT

### REG NUMBER: 212223230227
### NAME: T Thrishendra
