 # VIRTUAL MACHINE CREATION IN LINUX
  ## AIM
  To Install Virtualbox / VMware Workstation with different flavours of linux.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
 Manually executing basic Linux tasks like file management, navigation, and arithmetic operations can be inefficient. This experiment aims to automate these tasks using Bash scripting, including:

Displaying the current directory, files, and system date.

Reading and displaying file contents.

Performing basic arithmetic operations.


## ALGORITHM
 ### Steps 1:
 Open the terminal in Kali Linux.
 ### Steps 2:
 Use basic Linux commands to navigate and manage files.
 ### Steps 3:
 Create a Bash script using Mousepad.
 ### Steps 4:
 Write a script that performs arithmetic operations and reads a file.
 ### Steps 5:
 Make the script executable. 
 ### Steps 6:
 Run the script and observe the output.

## COMMANDS
Include the commands used in the Experiment.

check for current working directory:
```
pwd
```
make a directory named experiment :
```
mkdir experiment
```
change directory to experiment:
```
cd experiment
```
create a file named, add.sh:
```
nano add.sh
```
make the file executable:
```
chmod +x add.sh
```
rum the file:
```
./add.sh
```
include the code inside the file add.sh:
```
echo enter a:
read a
echo enter b:
read b
echo the sum is : $((a+b))
```
